This blog post contains the short notes of the book series, YDKJS by Kyle Simpson. This books series is a must read for anyone who wants to understand how JavaScript works internally. Each chapter is hosted separately in Notion pages. I am going to start with second book because first book is just basics of JavaScript programming and introduction to the book series which doesn't needs specific notes in my opinion. Still you can read the first book [<u>here</u>](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/1st-ed/up%20&%20going/README.md#you-dont-know-js-up--going).

### How to use these notes?
Best way would be to read these notes as a refresher after going through the books. Further you can take the reverse approach of going through the notes and then reading the books which will make it easy for you to read the book.
