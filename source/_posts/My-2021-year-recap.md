Hope this is not too late to write my 2021 recap post. 2021 was one of the best years Iâ€™ve ever had. It was more ups and very few downs this year. These are the highlights of my 2021:

**Aced my internship and got a full-time offer:** In 2020, I got an internship offer to work at [<u>Walmart</u>](https://walmart.com/). The internship started in Jan and ended in July. The internship experience was great and I was extended a full-time offer post-internship. I will write an article on my internship experience soon.

**Bought my first two-wheeler by myself.**

**Archived CovidBot:** which is a Telegram bot to get Covid stats of India, it has been used 8K times till now. I have to archive the project because the API I was using was discontinued, thus either I had to shift to another API (re-write the whole app) or archive the project. I had to choose the latter due to my other commitments.

**Coursera HD Video Downloader hits 3K users:** which is one of my first projects reaching this milestone. I am planning to make more extensions/projects in 2022 and acquire users.

**Content Creation:** I created [<u>rahulgurung.com</u>](http://rahulgurung.com), where I have all my work hosted comprising of articles, work experience and projects. I started writing online and started a newsletter to track and share my progress on this tech career that I am pursuing.
